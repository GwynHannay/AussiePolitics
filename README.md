# Aussie Politics

A project to retrieve the most unbiased data possible about politics in Australia. Most work right now is stored in the ```feature/load_gov_docs``` branch as a utility to retrieve all legislation from https://www.legislation.gov.au and compare compilations of various acts, bills, and the constitution.

Further enhancements planned include the ability to cross reference these changes with which government was residing at the time, which ministers were in charge of those portfolios, and even transcripts of parliamentary sessions where those changes were discussed.
